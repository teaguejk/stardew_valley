The First Day
==============

One year in Stardew Valley Consists of 4 months of 28 days representing the four seasons: Spring, Summer,
Fall and Winter. The game will always start in Spring.

Once you arrive on the farm, you will be given the necessary tools to start farming, and you will be given 15 
parsnip seeds. 

**You should:**

1. Plan where you would like to put your crops 
2. Start clearing the area around it with your tools. 
3. Plant the seeds in the area you would like and water them. You will need to water them once every day before the next day starts. After progressing further into the game you can unlock sprinklers to automate this process.


**Next**:

1. Head east to the town area, you will find Pierres shop. He sells seeds and decorations for your farm. 
2. You should spend around 500g on seeds for the spring time and then head home to plant and water them. 
3. That should be all for the first day. 
4. You can head to the bed in your house. 

The rest of the days in the game will be similar to this. You can chose how you spend your days and the different skills and professions you want to pursue.
